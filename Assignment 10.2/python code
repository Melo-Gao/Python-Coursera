10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. 
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.


name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
counts = dict()
time = list()
for line in handle:
    if not line.startswith("From"):
        continue
    pieces = line.split()
    if len(pieces) < 3:
        continue
    hour = pieces[5].split(':')
    time.append(hour[0])
for t in time:
    counts[t] = counts.get(t,0) + 1

for k,v in sorted(counts.items()):
    print(k,v)
