9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. 
After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
emails = list()
for line in handle:
	if not line.startswith('From'):
		continue
	pieces = line.split()
	if len(pieces)<3:
		continue
	emails.append(pieces[1])
	count = dict()
	for email in emails:
		count[email] = count.get(email,0)+1
		bigcount = None
		bigemail = None
			for email,count in count.items():
				if bigcount is None or count > bigcount:
					bigemail = email
					bigcount = count
print(bigemail, bigcount)
